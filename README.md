##Git commit rules 

 Commit Messages

## Format of the commit message:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```


## Message subject (first line)
First line cannot be longer than 70 characters, second line is always
blank and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.

### Allowed `<type>` values:

* **feature** (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
* **fix** (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
* **dep** (change dependency versions)
* **docs** (changes to the documentation)
* **style** (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
* **refactor** (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
* **test** (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
* **chore** (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
* **release** (updating package version numbers for a release)

### Example `<scope>` values:

* init
* runner
* watcher
* config
* web-server
* proxy
* etc.

The `<scope>` can be empty (eg. if the change is a global or difficult
to assign to a single component), in which case the parentheses are
omitted.


## Message body
* uses the imperative, present tense: `change` not `changed` nor `changes`
* includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior
